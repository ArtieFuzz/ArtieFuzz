<h3>Howdy, i'm Artie~</h3>

I'm a programmer from Australia. I am homosexual and a femboy. My preferred pronouns are she/her, but i won't be upset if you use he/him.

I'm more of a Gamer than a Coder.

I enjoy playing games like <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15146700">Osu</a> (<a href="http://osuskills.com/user/ArtieFuzzt">Skills</a>), Minecraft, and many more <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtieFuzzz/">Steam</a>.


Thanks for checking my profile out ^w^

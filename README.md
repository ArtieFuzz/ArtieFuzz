<h3>Howdy, i'm Artie~</h3>

I'm a programmer from Australia. I am homosexual. My preferred pronouns are she/her, but i won't be upset if you use he/him. Check out my [GitLab Group](https://gitlab.com/raven0-bot) this is where the source code for my discord bot Raven is stored and where other projects are now being kept

I'm more of a Gamer than a Coder

I'm currently learning C# (So far so good)

I enjoy playing games like <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15146700">Osu</a> (<a href="http://osuskills.com/user/ArtieFuzz">Skills</a>), Garry's Mod, and many more games on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtieFuzzz/">Steam</a>.

![SnowFlake's github stats](https://snowflake-ui-git-stats.vercel.app/api?username=ArtieFuzzz&show_icons=true&theme=vue-dark)
<br>Most of the commits are just me working on my discord bot.

Thanks for checking my profile out ^w^
